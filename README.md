## My process

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS (Flexbox + CSS Grid)
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles and themes
- Vite
- Storybook

### What I learned
This was my first project where the majority of CSS was done via Styled Components. This was also my first time using the ThemeProvider provided by Styled Components. I think the project went well and I was able to refactor a large chunk of my original code for this page. Overall, I like using Styled Components over my previous strategy of having component-based css files.

### Continued development
In the future, I want to continue to used Styled Components while also experimenting with tailwind to see which one I prefer. I also need to get more familiar with setting images as part of the background since I struggled with the circles and rings in the project.
